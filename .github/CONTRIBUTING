# Contributing to Jackdaw

If you discover issues, have ideas for improvements or new features,
please report them to the [issue tracker][1] of the repository or
submit a pull request. Please, try to follow these guidelines when you
do so.

## Issue reporting

* Check that the issue has not already been reported.
* Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code
  (a.k.a. `master`).
* Open an issue with a descriptive title and a clear, concise and precise statement of the problem 
* Mention any pertinent information about the "stack" you are using
* Mention the version (or versions) of Jackdaw you're trying to use

* Include any relevant code to the issue summary.

### Reporting bugs

When reporting bugs it's a good idea to go through the [Troubleshooting section
of the manual][7].  Adding information like the backtrace and any sample messages
and/or topic configurations used to the bug report makes it easier to track down bugs.
Some steps to reproduce a bug reliably would also make a huge difference.

## Pull requests

* Read the [Hacking on Jackdaw][8] manual section.
* Read [how to properly contribute to open source projects on Github][2].
* Use a topic branch to easily amend a pull request later, if necessary.
* Try not to update existing conventions of any code that you change.
* Make sure that the unit tests are passing (`lein test`).
* Write [good commit messages][3].
* Mention related tickets in the commit messages (e.g. `[Fix #N] Add command ...`).
* Update the [changelog][6].
* [Squash related commits together][5].
* Open a [pull request][4] that relates to *only* one subject with a clear title
  and description in grammatically correct, complete sentences.
